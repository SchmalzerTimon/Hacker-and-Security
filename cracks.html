            <h3>What is a Crack?</h3>
            Crackers circumvent or break access barriers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"> computersystem</a> and <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechnernetz"> computer network</a>.
            This generally includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie">scriptkiddie </a> and hackers who focus their activities on bypassing security mechanisms
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also Programmers who practice a sport on a mental level using CrackMe competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>When was Cracking first used?</h3>
            Cracking first took place in the 1980s with the proliferation of copy protection measures in commercial computer games, but it is found in every other category of computer program as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Different Type of Cracks</h3>
            <li>License number crack (also: <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_generator_(Warez)"> Keygenerator</a> or Keymaker, KeyGen for short) create a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizenz"> license number</a> to activate a product. 
                In some cases, the programmer of the crack must have knowledge of the original license numbers in order to be able to reprogram the algorithm. 
                As a security measure, some software manufacturers rely on activation keys, 
                with which each valid license number must also be activated via the Internet or telephone or, 
                in the case of applications that operate exclusively online, is checked each time it is started</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-CD-Crack"> No-CD/DVD </a> means that the target program, which would otherwise only run using the original CD/DVD, 
                can also be started without it. It can z. B. Run games without CD/DVD.
                A different crack is usually required for each program version.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>
                Backup CD/DVD means that the target program no longer queries the copy protection on the CD/DVD, but a CD/DVD is still required.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Mini backup images (see also <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulation">emulation </a>) are tiny images of large CDs that are only designed to simulate an existing copy protection. 
                You have the advantage of being able to <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Software)">patch </a> program (game) at will without needing a crack.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seriennummer">Serials</a> and keys are serial numbers or (CD) keys that are required to install programs or to unlock advanced functions (e.g. with <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware">shareware</a>). 
                These are often also referred to as serialz. These can be calculated by license number cracks or read from memory ("Serial fishing").
                The program is stopped by means of a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger">debugger</a> at the point in the test routine where the correct serial number calculated by the program is compared with the one entered by the user.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle">Dongle</a> emulations use a small program to simulate the alleged presence of a physical (USB) copy protection key 
                (e.g. Syncrosoft, Ilok, CodeMeter) that contains the license activation (via the Internet or pre-authorized).</li>
        </p>
         <p>
            <h3>Creating Cracks</h3>
            To create a crack, crackers primarily use <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler">disassemblers</a>, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger">debuggers</a>, and <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex-Editor">hex editors</a>. Nothing new is programmed, 
            only how the original code works in order to change the program in a targeted manner. 
            Advanced knowledge of the respective assembler language is necessary.
