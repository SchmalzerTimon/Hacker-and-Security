            <h3>What is a Crack?</h3>
            Crackers circumvent or break access barriers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"> computersystem</a> and <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechnernetz"> computer network</a>.
            This generally includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie">scriptkiddie </a> and hackers who focus their activities on bypassing security mechanisms
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also Programmers who practice a sport on a mental level using CrackMe competitions.

            <h3>When was Cracking first used?</h3>
            Cracking first took place in the 1980s with the proliferation of copy protection measures in commercial computer games, but it is found in every other category of computer program as well.

            <h3>Different Type of Cracks</h3>
            <li>License number crack (also: <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_generator_(Warez)"> Keygenerator</a> or Keymaker, KeyGen for short) create a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizenz"> license number</a> to activate a product. 
                In some cases, the programmer of the crack must have knowledge of the original license numbers in order to be able to reprogram the algorithm. 
                As a security measure, some software manufacturers rely on activation keys, 
                with which each valid license number must also be activated via the Internet or telephone or, 
                in the case of applications that operate exclusively online, is checked each time it is started</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-CD-Crack"> No-CD/DVD </a> means that the target program, which would otherwise only run using the original CD/DVD, 
                can also be started without it. It can z. B. Run games without CD/DVD.
                A different crack is usually required for each program version.</li>
