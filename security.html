        <p>There are three different types of Hacker</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>white hats</h3>
                <p>White hats test how safe the project is. They only hack in legal ways and work for companies.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>grey hats</h3>
                <p>Grey hats are not identified as "good" or "bad".</p>
                <p>They sometimes violate the hacker-ethics but they do it to reach a higher level.</p>
                <p>They try to publish security-vulnerabilities to stop deniers and to force the responsibles to remedy the vulnerabilities.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>black hats</h3>
                <p>Black hats work with kriminal energy to execute the assignment they got from the government or from a organization.</p>
                <p>If someone says you are a black hat, they refere to your type of hacking and not to you personally.</p>
            </li>
            <li>etymology
                <p>The names are from old western films where the heros wore white hats, that is why the legal hackers are called white hats.</p>
            </li>
